My research is about the modeling, control design, and analysis of **multi-robot systems**. The main objective is to make groups of autonomous robots **cooperate** in order to reach a disered behavior or carry out a specific task while dealing with the specific challenges of multi-robot systems such as **limited and local information** and **physical/interaction constraints**.

My current research is focused on four main subjects:

* Multi-objective control of **heterogeneous** robotic teams
* Shared control for **human-multi-robot collaboration**
* **Open multi-robot systems** for **resilience**
* **Synchronization and topology identification** of cooperative multi-agent systems
