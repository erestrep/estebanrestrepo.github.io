My research is about the design, control, and analysis of **multi-agent systems**. The main objective is to make groups of autonomous
agents **cooperate** in order to reach a disered behavior or carry out a specific task while dealing with the specific challenges of
multi-agent systems such as **limited and local information**, **physical and interaction constraints**, and

My research so far has been focused on three main subjects:

* Control of multi-aent systems under inter-agent **constraints**: application to autonomous **robotic vehicles** (ground, aerial, and marine).
* **Topology identification** of cooperative multi-agent systems
* Energy-aware design and control of **open multi-agent systems**.
