From February 2023 I am a Postdoctoral researcher in the [Rainbow Team](https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/) at IRISA, CNRS and Inria Bretagne Atlantique, Rennes, France, under the supervision of Dr. [Paolo Robuffo Giordano](https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/team/prg/). 

Before joining the Rainbow Team, from January 2022 to January 2023, I was a Postdoctoral researcher in the [Division of Decision and Control Systems](https://www.kth.se/is/dcs/division-of-decision-and-control-systems-1.788078) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden, under the supervision of Dr. [Dimos Dimarogonas](https://people.kth.se/~dimos/).

November 2021, I obtained the Ph.D. in Automatic Control from the Université Paris-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette, France. I carried out my PhD thesis on coordination control of robotic multi-agent systems under the supervision of Dr. [Antonio Loría](https://l2s.centralesupelec.fr/en/u/loria-antonio/), Dr. [Julien Marzat](http://julien.marzat.free.fr/), and Dr. Ioannis Sarras.

I got the M.Sc. degree in Robotic Systems Engineering from Arts et Métiers, Paris, France, in 2018, receiving the Silver Medal honorary distinction, after an internship at ONERA - The French Aerospace Lab, Palaiseau, France, under the supervision of Dr. Antonio Loría and Dr. Ioannis Sarras.

I received the B.Sc. degree in Mechatronics Engineering from Universidad EIA, Envigado, Colombia and from Arts et Métiers, Paris, France, in 2017, receiving the Silver Medal honorary distinction.
