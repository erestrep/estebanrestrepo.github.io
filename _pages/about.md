From February 2023 I am a Postdoctoral researcher in the [Rainbow Team](https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/) at IRISA, CNRS and Inria Bretagne Atlantique, Rennes, France, under the supervision of Dr. [Paolo Robuffo Giordano](https://team.inria.fr/rainbow/team/prg/). Previously, from January 2022 to January 2023, I was a Postdoctoral researcher in the [Division of Decision and Control Systems](https://www.kth.se/is/dcs/division-of-decision-and-control-systems-1.788078) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden. I received the PhD degree in Automatic Control from the Université Paris-Saclay, France, in 2021. I obtained the MSc degree from Arts et Métiers, Paris, France, in 2018, and the BSc degree from Universidad EIA, Envigado, Colombia and from Arts et Métiers, Paris, France, in 2017.

My Research
======

My research is focused on autonomous multi-agent systems using tools from dynamical-systems and control theory. In particular, my principal research activity is centered in the control design, study, and analysis of groups of autonomous robotic vehicles (ground, aerial, and marine) both from the control-theoretic and the practical-implementation perspectives.
